# Median Filter (Scala)
### Worked while taking CIIC4030 (Programming Languages) course at UPRM, Fall 2020.

This is project is an implementation of the [Median Filter Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter), which is a non-linear digital filtering technique used to reduce noise from an image or signal. In here, an implementation was made as a sequential implementation and another was made using a parallel implementations, following the idea of [Parallel Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing). Included are the source files with the implementation in Scala and a report of the performance of both implementations.
